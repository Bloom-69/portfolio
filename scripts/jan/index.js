            I don't know how to start this "Journal" thing that we are making
            for english class. But yet here we are nonetheless.

            January was rough, I was really, really distracted with my personal
            projects I usually have hosted on my github account. For example,
            I was finishing up our FRC robot's code, because the competition
            was starting in a few months. So I had to get going and start learning
            some programming paradigms that Java uses, for instance,
            classes, inheritance, abstraction, etc... And learning all of that
            in a very short amount of time is a daunting task to say the least.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, we managed to get the robot's basic parts to
            function properly.

            <i>Although</i>, at the same time, I was thinking about being trans.
